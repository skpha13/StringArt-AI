# StringNet

## Overview

stringart-ai is a Python-based project that provides a complete data pipeline and a suite of AI models trained to generate string art representations of images. The models are built using a custom dataset of procedurally generated string art configurations.

This repository includes:

- Data pipeline scripts for preprocessing and preparing training data
- AI models trained on string art configurations
- Tools for evaluating and visualizing results

The string art data used here is generated with the help of a separate procedural computing package.

This package contains the algorithmic methods used to compute the string patterns that form the backbone of the dataset.
